Hi 👋 I’m Yuxin Xiong, a Master’s student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/).

My research focuses on **Reasoning**, **Reinforcement Learning** and **Large Language Model (LLM) Agents** 🤖 — aiming to make language models more *intelligent*, *interpretable*, and *aligned* with human reasoning.
 
Previously, I collaborated with [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) on large-scale reasoning model training at UC San Diego. I also interned at **AWS AI Lab**, working with [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) agents and tool-augmented LLM reasoning. 

I’m currently open to Ph.D. positions (Fall 2026) 🎓 and new grad opportunities in AI/ML research and development 🚀.
