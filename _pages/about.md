Hi 👋 I’m Yuxin Xiong, a Master’s student in Computer Science at **UC San Diego** 🎓, advised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).  
Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, where I was advised by [Prof. Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/).

My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Reasoning**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** 🤖 — aiming to make language models more *intelligent*, *interpretable*, and *aligned* with human reasoning 🧭.
 
Previously, I collaborated with [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) on **large-scale reasoning model training** at UC San Diego. I also interned at **AWS AI Lab**, working with [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) on **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) agents** and **tool-augmented LLM reasoning**. 

I’m currently open to **Ph.D. positions (Fall 2026)** 🎓 and **new grad opportunities** in **AI/ML research and development** 🚀.
